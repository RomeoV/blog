Currently, I am working on certification protocols for machine learning systems in safety-critical domains; first in aerospace, but with future plans for medical, finance, and public policy. To progress with this task, I have been fortunate to join the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab. If you’re around Stanford and are interested in talking to me, let’s have a coffee!

My background is in computational mathematics, both theory and implementation, and mathematical optimization, which I applied to process systems optimization during my time at CMU. I have also worked in robotics, including embedded control, motion planning and autonomous navigation.

Prior to moving to Palo Alto I have lived in Aachen, Pittsburgh, Stuttgart, Zürich, and in my hometown Holtum. I love traveling and have traversed Vietnam and Peru by motorcycle (highly recommended), and backpacked through parts of Mexico (come for the party, stay for the nature and food). I am also an avid ballroom dancer and current vice-president of Stanford’s competitive ballroom team, currently dabbling in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and was fencing state-champion in Westphalia (NRW) during my teens.

📥 Check out my [[https://codeberg.org/romeov/cv-romeo-valentin/src/branch/master/cv_tabular.pdf][CV]].

My interests include:
- ML certification for safety-critical systems
- Probabilistic ML, Uncertainty quantification, Causality & Disentanglement
- Decision making under uncertainty
- Efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization
- Contributions to open science and open source software
- +Meeting Donald Knuth+ ✔️

* Commute times in Zürich

A [[https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/welche-stadt-den-schnellsten-oev-der-schweiz-hat-und-wieso-man-mit-dem-velo-trotzdem-schneller-ist-ld.1843690][recent article]] in the "Neue Züricher Zeitung" claims that Zürich public transport is "only" about twice the walking speed, and slower than biking.

To make up my own mind, I have evaluated some of my common trips for all three modes of transportation, using google maps.
Note that some trips start with "bike", which is me biking to the train station, which saves about 6 minutes. I have recorded it as I typically travel -- e.g. I don't bike to the train station when I go to the airport.

Note that I have not omitted any trips to doctor the data. So for my day-to-day life I can conclude that taking public transport or the bike is about the same, and consistently about 3x as fast as walking.

* DONE Car make reliability comparison :ATTACH:

Like many other countries, Finland mandates annual car inspections, and /unlike/ other countries, also [[https://tieto.traficom.fi/en/statistics/statistics-inspections][publishes this data]].
It aggregates inspection failure data per (make+model, year) and reports average and median odometer reading (i.e. distance driven).

We can therefore plot this data and try to draw our own conclusion. We plot cars produced since 2014 (ten years ago), where each dot represents a different (model, year) tuple, and
additionally fit a linear regression line.

#+caption: Car inspection failure probability by make and odometer reading.
[[attachment:plot.svg]]

** Some results
For the results, I will additionally include the mother company (if applicable).
The best results in this analysis seem to be for
- Honda
- Lexus (Toyota)
- Suzuki
- Toyota
However, none of their models exceed a median odometer reading of 150 thousand km.

Next up we have a big bulk of manufacturers with similar results, including
- Audi (VW)
- BMW
- Ford
- Mazda
- Mini (BMW)
- Mitsubishi (RNM)
- Porsche (VW)
- Skoda (VW)
- Subaru
- Volkswagen
- Volvo

Then we see some "high-risers", which start of with a low intercept, but rise to high failure rates quickly:
- Hyundai
- Jaguar (Tata Motors)
- Kia (Hyundai)
- Mercedes-Benz
- Nissan (RNM)
- Opel (Stellantis)
- Peugot (Stellantis)

Finally we have the "top outliers" that start with a high intercept and keep rising steeply.
These include
- Citroen (Stellantis)
- Dacia (RNM)
- Renault (RNM)
- Tesla

And to close, we find Seat (VW), with a strange downward slope, which I can not explain. (The sample size of all Seats, ~11k, is close to the median sample size across all makes, ~12k).

** Do brands differ within the same mother company?
We can see that results line up quite closely per-mother company.
For instance, under the Hyundai corporation, Kia and Hyundai have very similar regression lines (left plot).
Similarly the Stellantis brands Opel, Peugot, and Citroen, line up relatively closely, and so do the Volkswagen brands, although Audi seems to be the "best" of those.
For RNM, we find Mitsubishi outperforming the others, namely Nissan, Dacia, and Renault.
Finally, both Toyota and its sub-brand Lexus have among the best results.

** Some caveats
- Cars are bought for different purposes and thus may receive different levels of care. For instance, a car typically bought for recreational driving may receive a different level of care by its owner as compared to cars bought for work purposes.
- Factors of car strain, such as temperature, snowfall, road surface, may be different in Finland compared to other countries.
- One might expect electric car manufacturers to have lower inspection failures due to the relatively lower number of components. However, I can't find such a relation in the data, and notably, Tesla stands out with the highest rate of failures.
