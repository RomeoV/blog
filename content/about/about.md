Currently, I am working on certification protocols for machine learning systems in safety-critical domains; first in aerospace, but with future plans for medical, finance, and public policy. To progress with this task, I have been fortunate to join the Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab. If you‚Äôre around Stanford and are interested in talking to me, let‚Äôs have a coffee!

My background is in computational mathematics, both theory and implementation, and mathematical optimization, which I applied to process systems optimization during my time at CMU. I have also worked in robotics, including embedded control, motion planning and autonomous navigation.

Prior to moving to Palo Alto I have lived in Aachen, Pittsburgh, Stuttgart, Z√ºrich, and in my hometown Holtum. I love traveling and have traversed Vietnam and Peru by motorcycle (highly recommended), and backpacked through parts of Mexico (come for the party, stay for the nature and food). I am also an avid ballroom dancer and current vice-president of Stanford‚Äôs competitive ballroom team, currently dabbling in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and was fencing state-champion in Westphalia (NRW) during my teens.

My interests include:

-   ML certification for safety-critical systems
-   Probabilistic ML, Uncertainty quantification, Causality &amp; Disentanglement
-   Decision making under uncertainty
-   Efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization
-   Contributions to open science and open source software
-   ~~Meeting Donald Knuth~~ ‚úîÔ∏è
